/**
 * @addtogroup OpenCASCADE
 * @{
 * We collect in this namespace all utilities which operate on
 * OpenCASCADE entities. OpenCASCADE splits every object into a
 * topological description and a geometrical entity. The basic
 * topological description is a TopoDS_Shape. TopoDS_Shapes are light
 * objects, and can be copied around. The closest deal.II analog is a
 * TriaIterator.
 *
 * The OpenCASCADE topology is designed with reference to the STEP
 * standard ISO-10303-42.  The structure is an oriented one-way graph,
 * where parents refer to their children, and there are no back
 * references. Abstract structure is implemented as C++ classes from
 * the TopoDS package. A TopoDS_Shape is manipulated by value and
 * contains 3 fields: location, orientation and a myTShape handle (of
 * the TopoDS_TShape type). According to OpenCASCADE documentation,
 * myTShape and Location are used to share data between various shapes
 * and thus save huge amounts of memory. For example, an edge
 * belonging to two faces has equal Locations and myTShape fields but
 * different Orientations (Forward in context of one face and Reversed
 * in one of the other).
 *
 * Valid shapes include collection of other shapes, solids, faces,
 * edges, vertices, etc.
 *
 * Once a topological description is available, if a concrete
 * geometrical object can be created, the BRep classes allow one to
 * extract the actual geometrical information from a shape.
 *
 * This is done by inheriting abstract topology classes from the
 * TopoDS package by those implementing a boundary representation
 * model (from the BRep package). Only 3 types of topological objects
 * have geometric representations â€“ vertex, edge, and face.
 *
 * Every TopoDS_Shape can be queried to figure out what type of shape
 * it is, and actual geometrical objects, like surfaces, curves or
 * points, can be extracted using BRepTools.
 *
 * In this namespace we provide readers and writers that read standard
 * CAD files, and return a TopoDS_Shape, or that write a CAD file,
 * given a TopoDS_Shape. Most of the functions in the OpenCASCADE
 * namespace deal with TopoDS_Shapes of one type or another, and
 * provide interfaces to common deal.II objects, like Triangulation,
 * Manifold, and so on.
 *
 * Notice that these tools are only useful when spacedim is equal to
 * three, since OpenCASCADE only operates in three-dimensional mode.
